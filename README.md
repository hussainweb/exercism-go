## What is this?

These are just [my solutions](https://exercism.io/profiles/hussainweb) to the problems on the Go track on Exercism. Use it as you see fit. :)

Recently, I enrolled in [Go-hort](https://exercism.org/cohorts/gohort) and resumed the exercises here in the new study format. Commits from before 15th August, 2022 are the old exercises. You can view the tree [here](https://github.com/hussainweb/exercism-go/tree/2924163172b3746947a2a753957687eca43c46d1).
